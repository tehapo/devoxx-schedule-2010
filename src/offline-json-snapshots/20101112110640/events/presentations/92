Generally speaking, what's new in Hibernate?\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will check out the new features of Hibernate and in particular the one coming from Java Persistence 2. They will be explored in live coding sessions.\r\n\r\nWe will explore: \r\n - the new type-safe Criteria API as well as its close brother the new Hibernate Static metamodel generator\r\n - the new locking options and their consequences for your applications\r\n - Infinispan's new second level cache\r\n - fetch profiles\r\n - the new partial generators\r\n - and many more things\r\n\r\nWe will also walk through what's beyond Hibernate Core: Hibernate has slowly grown from the ORM to a set of domain model centric tools like validation, full-text search and so on:\r\n - Hibernate Validator and the Bean Validation specification\r\n - Hibernate Envers and temporal data support\r\n - Hibernate Search and full-text search for Hibernate applications.\r\n\r\nGeneral knowledge of Hibernate or ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is preferred.","id":92,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/117","title":"What's new in Hibernate: a JPA 2 perspective","speaker":"Emmanuel Bernard","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/117","speaker":"Emmanuel Bernard"}],"type":"University (3h)"}
