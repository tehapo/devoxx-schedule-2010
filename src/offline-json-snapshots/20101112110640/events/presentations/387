{"tags":[{"name":"performance"},{"name":"puzzlers"}],"summary":"Not too long ago, it was reasonably straightforward to predict the performance of computer programs. But as the performance of the underlying systems improved, their <i>performance models<\/i> got worse; in other words, our ability to predict, or even measure, the performance of a program eroded. In this talk, we explore the roots of the problem, demonstrate it in action, and discuss what we can do to cope with it.","id":387,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/314","title":"Performance Anxiety","speaker":"Joshua Bloch","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"EXPERT","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/314","speaker":"Joshua Bloch"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
