{"tags":[{"name":"AIR"},{"name":"FLEX"}],"summary":"Using a combination of Java, JMS, and Flash, data can be visualized in real time on a client. Real-time visualizations can be in dashboards, heat maps, charts, and numerous other interactive controls. Intended for developers looking to create applications with real-time data visualizations, this session will show how to set up a system that pushes real-time messages to a client from a Java EE server and how to create a rich internet application that renders the data. It will demonstrate how to:\r\n\r\n* Configure a Java EE system that can push JMS messages to a client in\r\nreal-time or near real-time\r\n\r\n* Build a Flash client application that renders data from the server\r\n\r\n* Connect a client to messages using HTTP Streaming and HTTP Long Polling\r\n\r\nWe'll also discover how to enable in few minutes a text chat application, a video chat app, and a even a shared whiteboard application.","id":393,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/331","title":"Making Real-Time Data Come Alive","speaker":"Michael Chaize","track":"Desktop/RIA/Mobile","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/331","speaker":"Michael Chaize"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
