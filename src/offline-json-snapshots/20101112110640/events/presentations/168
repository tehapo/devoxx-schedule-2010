{"tags":[{"name":"DevOps"},{"name":"cloud"}],"summary":"When you mix together sysadmins and code-monkeys, you get a weird cocktail called \"dev/ops\" - development and operations. Pulled from the successful practices of high-scale web companies like flickr and enterprises developing on the bleeding edge of application delivery, the promise is to make the lives of each better and, hopefully, allow their organizations to deliver better software, faster, and more frequently. dev/ops theory is still new - even shorter in its buzzword pants than \"cloud\"! Still, this evolving body of theory, practice, and tools looks extremity attractive.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Michael Cot√© and John Willis (the co-hosts of the popular IT Management & Cloud Podcast) will catch you up on what dev/ops is looking like and how it might help (or harm!) you. This session will give you a pragmatic overview of dev/ops and leave with a better idea of how dev/ops applies to you and your organization.\r\n\r\nIf you have heard the term devops and it either offends, amusing or intrigues you, please plan to spend an hour with Michael and John in this session.","id":168,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/167","title":"Does dev/ops matter for me?","speaker":"Michael Cote","track":"Cloud/NoSQL","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/167","speaker":"Michael Cote"},{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/230","speaker":"John Willis"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
