{"tags":[{"name":"HTML5"},{"name":"W3C"},{"name":"XHR"},{"name":"websockets"}],"summary":"W3C\u2019s HTML5 standard has rapidly gained momentum as 2010\u2019s hottest technology with help from companies, such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Developers and businesses alike are all trying to catch and align themselves with this new standard. Out of all the ideas and features in this new set of specifications, the most intriguing, exciting, and controversial section is HTML5 WebSocket.  At first glance, some misinterpret WebSocket as merely a better transport protocol and replacement of HTTP or XHR.  However, upon additional understanding, one quickly learns WebSocket is NOT a replacement or improved version of HTTP or XHR, nor do we want it to be! \r\n\r\nIf we look at the current hype around PaaS, Cloud, pre-built business widgets and applications, virtualization, payments etc\u2026  they have all forgotten to look at the road. The actual tarmac that makes all of this communicate. We all assumed the Web was just there, and that HTTP provided everything we needed for Web communication. HTML5 WebSocket is the evolution of the communication fabric TO, ACROSS and WITHIN the Web/Cloud, and now we need to open our minds and start looking at the possibilities of this new way to communicate over the Web!  Think BIG, really BIG!\r\n\r\nThis session is targeted developers and architects that are looking for better ways of increasing user experience and communication over the Web to create, improve, or replace existing Web applications.  The session is also targeted developers and architects that just want to stretch their minds and receive the necessary information on making an educated assessment of the business and technical opportunities, and challenges, made possible by this new HTML5 standard. Wickedly cool demos, code examples, and comparisons with existing technologies and architectures will be used to illustrate these possibilities and their use cases.","id":49,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/63","title":"HTML5 Websockets: A New World of Limitless, Live, and Wickedly Cool Web Applications","speaker":"Jonas Jacobi","track":"Architecture/Security","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/63","speaker":"Jonas Jacobi"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
