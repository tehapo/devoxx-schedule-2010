{"tags":[{"name":"javase"},{"name":"JVM"}],"summary":"Updating a running web application in Java is not small feat. With just one server you have no choice, but to bring it down for the time of redeployment. For a cluster of servers you have to take servers down one by one and make sure that the old user sessions stick to the servers that are yet to be updated. There are some solutions out there, but they are not perfect.\r\n\r\nBut what if you could roll out the update instantly with a press of a button to all of the servers, without waiting for the users to migrate? And what if you could roll back that update just as easily in case of any issues? In this short talk I'd like to show how LiveRebel can solve this issues, so you don't have to.","id":385,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/376","title":"Instant Updates and Rollbacks in Production Applications","speaker":"Toomas Römer","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/376","speaker":"Toomas Römer"}],"type":"Quickie (15m)"}
