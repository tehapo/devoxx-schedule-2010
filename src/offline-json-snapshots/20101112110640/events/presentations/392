Don't get their first experience with your hard work screwed by an arcane installation and configuration process!\r\n\r\nIzPack is a one-stop solution for packaging, distributing and deploying applications for the Java platform. A solid project nearing its 10 years landmark, IzPack is an Apache-licensed Codehaus project whose mission is to make it easy for you to build the installers that will keep your users happy just right before they get their hands on your software.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we will see:\r\n* the main features of IzPack\r\n* how you tweak and extend it for your very special needs\r\n* how the very same installer can run on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, BSD, Solaris and still provide integration with the underlying operating system\r\n* that IzPack is no silver bullet, and how it complements other deployment solutions.\r\n\r\nAside from the non-crashing live demos and name dropping, the talk will conclude with some quick return of experience on managing an opensource project that started for fun in a student dorm room, and ended up being used by very serious people.","id":392,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/381","title":"IzPack: because you and your end users have installation issues","speaker":"Julien Ponge","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/381","speaker":"Julien Ponge"}],"type":"Tools in Action (30m)"}
