Specifically how JAX-RS may be utilized with Servlet 3.0, CDI 1.0 and EJB 3.1. Live coding demonstrations will be presented. Developers will learn how to use JAX-RS with Java EE 6.\r\n\r\nThe second part will focus on the future of JAX-RS such as what may be in scope for a JAX-RS 2.0 effort in the Java Community Process and the potential for JAX-RS to integrate with other technologies.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the latter the focus will be on how JAX-RS can integrate with asynchronous processing using Comet and Web Socket using Jersey (the JAX-RS implementation that provides the Reference Implementation) and Atmosphere (a high-level portable asynchronous framework). A live coding demonstration will be presented.","id":217,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/224","title":"JAX-RS, Java EE 6, and the future","speaker":"Paul Sandoz","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/224","speaker":"Paul Sandoz"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
