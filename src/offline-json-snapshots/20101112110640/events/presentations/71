In the client case, there is the asynchronous API pattern in JAX-WS that allows a Web service proxy to be notified when a call to an asynchronous Web service has finished without blocking the original sending request. But true asychronicity can be achieved only at the server side.\r\n\r\nThis session is intended for anyone who develops, designs, and architects Web services-based applications. The session will address: \r\n* Client-side asynchrony based on JAX-WS\r\n* Server-side asynchrony\r\n* WS-Addressing for correlation of message and response\r\n* Implementations of asynchronous services\r\n* Building asynchronous clients using callbacks or MakeConnection","id":71,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/101","title":"Dealing with Asynchronicity in Javaâ„¢ Technology-Based Web Services","speaker":"Nilesh Junnarkar","track":"Architecture/Security","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/101","speaker":"Nilesh Junnarkar"}],"type":"Bof (1h)"}
