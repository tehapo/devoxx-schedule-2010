{"tags":[{"name":"Methodology"},{"name":"Design"}],"summary":"Everyone writing a library function is designing an API. But do we always take the necessary care? Literate testing is an approach that gently guides you towards that care. You will create usable APIs, with better documentation and the most important tests: code examples. Design becomes a dialogue between documentation, examples-turned-tests and implementation sketches.\r\n\r\nLiterate testing is not new, but deserves wider usage in the Java world. In the talk, I'll present the approach in detail as well as a supporting tool called JCite.\r\n\r\nMore information, references and links to actual APIs designed this way at http://arrenbrecht.ch/testing/.","id":144,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/146","title":"Literate Testing: Justifying APIs Makes Them Better","speaker":"Peter Arrenbrecht","track":"Methodology","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/146","speaker":"Peter Arrenbrecht"}],"type":"Tools in Action (30m)"}
