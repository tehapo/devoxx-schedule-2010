{"tags":[{"name":"caching"},{"name":"Ehcache"}],"summary":"I have talked to a lot of people about Ehcache over the years. What people find most valuable, and what stays with them, is the underlying caching theory - you can see the light bulb go on.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we will start with a performance problem and lead you through solving it with caching, discovering a long the way the problems of distributed caching and their solution. This will equip you with the tools to analyze a performance situation and to see whether a cache will help and what type of cache to apply.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\n* Why caching works\r\n* Standalone cache performance and effectiveness\r\n* Tiered Cache Design\r\n* N * Problem\r\n* Cache Cluster topologies\r\n* Cache Coherency Problem\r\n* CAP and PACELC constraints\r\n* Useful Cache Patterns","id":391,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/380","title":"The essence of Caching","speaker":"Greg Luck","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/380","speaker":"Greg Luck"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
