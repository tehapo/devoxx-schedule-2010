This talk is about why AST transformations are important, what you can do with them, and where the language world is headed.\r\n\r\nWe'll dive into some of the useful Groovy annotations and libraries being written that harness AST transformations, such as the Spock Testing framework, GContracts for Design by Contract in Groovy, and the new Groovy 1.8 features. \r\n\r\nI am a Groovy committer and this is the area that I contribute in. There should be some really cool stuff to show off by November.","id":148,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/151","title":"Groovy Code Generation","speaker":"Hamlet D'Arcy","track":"New Languages on the JVM","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/151","speaker":"Hamlet D'Arcy"}],"type":"Quickie (15m)"}
