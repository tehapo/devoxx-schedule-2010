{"tags":[{"name":"Activiti"},{"name":"BPM"}],"summary":"Learn about Activiti and how you can benefit from the BPM and workflow features in your next Java project.  \r\n\r\nOne aspect of Business Process Management (BPM) is to facilitate the collaboration between business people and developers.\r\n\r\nBut also developers find it often just the simplest way to implement their requirements.  When dealing with task lists, timers and asynchronous messages, it can be a challenge to bind all the hooks and eyes together.  In these asynchronous architectures, Activiti is at its best.  \r\n\r\nWith Activiti, developers can create an overview diagram that represents the overall transactional control flow.  We'll show how easy it is to link this process to your Java domain logic classes.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect of using Activiti is that you get the valuable history analysis reports and audit logs for free.  For example, how many successful deals did we have for each region in less then 20 days.  Or who gave permission for this purchase and what was the motivation.  By default, the Activiti engine collects information for each process execution.  \r\n\r\nIn this session we'll demonstrate these features as well as the different components of the Activiti project.","id":205,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/214","title":"Activiti in Action","speaker":"Tom Baeyens","track":"Architecture/Security","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/214","speaker":"Tom Baeyens"},{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/245","speaker":"Joram Barrez"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
