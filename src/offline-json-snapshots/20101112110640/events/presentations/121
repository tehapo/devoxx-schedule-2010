This session covers the approach for building lean, but still maintainable and scalable applications with nothing but plain Java EE 6 technologies. A (rich) JPA 2.0 domain object can be annotated with JSR-303 (Bean Validation) for validation purposes, EJB 3.1 Stateless / Stateful Session Bean provide the transactionality, remoting (JAX-RS / REST), concurrency. JSR-299 (CDI) enables the direct exposure to to the JSF 2 view and extension points, as well as aspects. \r\nThe interesting point: such minimalistic architecture still remains extensible and testable.\r\n\r\nThe pragmatic combination of EJB 3.1, JPA 2.0, Bean Validation, Context and Dependency Injection and JAX-RS (REST) will be covered from the real world angle and is especially interesting to Java (EE) developers and architects:\r\n- Pragmatic modularization and deployment of WARs / EARs\r\n- Stateful vs stateless architectures\r\n- Domain driven design vs. service oriented components\r\n- Component configuration with EJB 3.1, interceptors and CDI\r\n- incremental migration from J2EE","id":121,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/131","title":"Creating Lightweight Applications With Nothing But Vanilla Java EE 6","speaker":"Adam Bien","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/131","speaker":"Adam Bien"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
