{"tags":[{"name":"annotations"},{"name":"patterns"}],"summary":"We all know how patterns can be used to improve our software designs.  Most of us have read at least one pattern book.  Patterns give us a way to tell future developers what our intention was when we built the software.  However, most often, the pattern is not consistently documented.  In this talk, we will show why it is impossible to accurately determine the pattern based on the class structure.  We then introduce a new set of annotations that we use to describe our pattern usage in our code.  We end off with a case study where we annotate the famous junit framework to describe their patterns.  As you will see, our jpatterns.org annotations make the patterns stand out far more clearly, making it easier for experts and novices to work on existing code.","id":359,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/265","title":"jpatterns.org - Annotations for Pointing out Patterns in Your Code","speaker":"Heinz Kabutz","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/265","speaker":"Heinz Kabutz"}],"type":"Bof (1h)"}
