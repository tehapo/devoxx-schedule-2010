{"tags":[{"name":"scalable"},{"name":"REST"},{"name":"JAX-RS"}],"summary":"The 'new web' is about user-centric UIs, about improved state management, and about fast prototyping of flexible web applications. However, non-functional requirements for web-centric ventures are also about providing scalability and availability without much extra cost. Scaling out to the cloud has become a hard requirement for all internet development, in order to allow business growth without expensive re-architecture.\r\n\r\nIn this 30 minute session, we will show some of the hard challenges to be met when building large-scale web applications, and how a pragmatic REST approach can come to the rescue. We will explain how to combine Kauri (a modular RESTful webapp framework) with Lily (a scalable content store based on HBase, Hadoop and SOLR) to create a modern web internet infrastructure that scales well.","id":166,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/160","title":"Scalable and RESTful web applications: at the crossroads of Kauri and Lily","speaker":"Marc Portier","track":"Web Frameworks","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/160","speaker":"Marc Portier"}],"type":"Tools in Action (30m)"}
