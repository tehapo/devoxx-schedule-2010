{"id":58,"lastName":"Milicev","bio":"Dr. Dragan Milicev is Associate Professor and Chairman of the Software Engineering Department at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Electrical Engineering (www.etf.rs). He is specialized in software engineering, model-driven development, UML, object-oriented programming, software architecture and design, and information systems. He has published papers in some of the most prestigious scientific and professional journals and magazines (including IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering), contributing to the theory and practice of model-driven development and UML. He is also a member of the program committees of two most prestigious international conferences on model-based engineering (MODELS and ECMFA).\r\nHe is the author of three previous bestselling books on object-oriented programming and UML, published in Serbian. His new book, recently published by Wiley/Wrox, \u201cModel-Driven Development with Executable UML,\u201d has brought out some original ideas and improvements to the field of rapid model-based development of information systems, boosting the efficiency of development dramatically. It has already gained an international recognition with positive reviews and feedbacks by independent reviewers, such as: http://www.amazon.com/Model-Driven-Development-Executable-Wrox-Programmer/product-reviews/0470481633/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1 http://ooatool.blogspot.com/2009/12/week-50-of-2009.html\r\nWith more than 25 years of extensive industrial experience in building complex commercial software systems, he has been serving as the chief software architect, project manager, or consultant in a few dozen international projects, some of them having national scope and importance.\r\nHe is the founder of Serbian Object Laboratories d.o.o. (SOL, www.sol.rs), a software research and development company specialized in designing software development tools using model-driven approach, as well as in building custom applications and systems. He was chief software architect and project manager for most of SOL\u2019s projects and all its products: SOLoist, a rapid application model-driven development framework for information systems; SOL UML Visual Debugger, one of the world\u2019s first UML visual debuggers, designed for Poseidon for UML modeling tool; and SOL Java Visual Debugger, a plug-in for Eclipse that enables modeling of test object structures and visualizing Java object space using object diagrams, as well as conducting testing and debugging by visual interactions through diagrams (a tool under development).","company":"SOL","talks":[{"title":"SOLoist: A Java-Based Framework for Model-Driven Development of Enterprise Web Applications with Executable UML","event":"Tools in Action (30m)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/40"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/static/images/58/thumbnail.gif","firstName":"Dragan"}
