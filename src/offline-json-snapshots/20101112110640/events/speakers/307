{"id":307,"lastName":"Pugh","bio":"William Pugh received a B.S. in Computer Science from Syracuse University and received a Ph.D. in Computer Science (with a minor in Acting) from Cornell University. He is currently a professor at the University of Maryland, College Park.\r\n\r\nWilliam Pugh is a Packard Fellow, and invented Skip Lists, a randomized data structure that is widely taught in undergraduate data structure courses.\r\n\r\nHe has also made research contributions in the fields of incremental computation, implementation of functional and object-oriented languages, the use of partial evaluation for hard real-time systems, in techniques for analyzing and transforming scientific codes for execution on supercomputers, and in a number of issues related to the Java programming language, including the development of JSR 133 - Java Memory Model and Thread Specification Revision.\r\n\r\nProf. Pugh consulted for Google in 2000 - 2003 on research that resulted in US Patent 665 8423, on detecting duplicate and near-duplicate files.\r\n\r\nProf Pugh's current research focus is on developing tools to improve software productivity, reliability and education. Current research projects include FindBugs, a static analysis tool for Java, and Marmoset, an innovative framework for improving the learning and feedback cycle for student programming projects.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pugh spent the 2008-2009 school year on sabbatical at Google, where, among other activities, he learned how to eat fire.","company":"Univ. of Maryland","talks":[{"title":"Defective Java: Mistakes that matter","event":"Conference (1h)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/362"},{"title":"Java Puzzlers - Scraping the Bottom of the Barrel","event":"Conference (1h)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/366"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/static/images/307/thumbnail.gif","firstName":"William"}
