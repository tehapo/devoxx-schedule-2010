{"id":27,"lastName":"Bachorik","bio":"Jaroslav has got a MSc. degree in IT. He has started his professional IT career more than 10 years ago in 2008 working as a trainee in Norwegian leading BI and warehousing consultancy company, IC Group Norway. After the trial period he was given a position of junior developer and took care of analysis and implementation of smaller projects. After returning back to his home country he set up a developer workshop company (7 people) specialized mainly in DB oriented applications. Technologies varied from MS Access to J2EE application deployed on JBoss.  Basically, the company went bankrupt and he moved on. The next step was cca. 4 years spent in a company specialized on DMS solutions. He cycled between senior developer, analyst, architect and team lead positions so he had a chance to wear each hat. In the end he had the feeling he wanted to do something more \"tekkie\" and left for Sun Microsystems. Since 2006 he's been employed by Sun Microsystems as a senior software developer. He's taken part in various projects like NetBeans Profiler, VisualVM (jvisualvm) and JavaFX Editor support. He was driving his own projects like NetBeans JMeter integration and completely self standing project BTrace - together with its bindings for VisualVM and NetBeans.\r\n\r\nThis experience gives him insight to the whole line of software development - from requirements gathering and analysis, through design and implementation to performance management and application maintenance.","company":"Sun Microsystems","talks":[{"title":"VisualVM - multiplatform versatile monitoring solution","event":"Tools in Action (30m)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/115"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/static/images/27/thumbnail.gif","firstName":"Jaroslav"}
