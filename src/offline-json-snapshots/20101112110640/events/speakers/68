{"id":68,"lastName":"Noels","bio":"Steven Noels is co-founder and CEO of Outerthought, makers of the open source Daisy CMS, the Kauri webapp framework and Lily, the first NoSQL-based content repository. Previously deeply infected by the angle brackets bug, he ventured from ancient SGML rites to hipsters' XML and then internet applications and onwards. Outerthought is a Belgian software technology provider on the crossroads of open source, REST, NoSQL and Java-based internet development. Steven is an Apache Software Foundation member, a board member of Gent BC, the platform for the Ghent innovation and technology community and has been sighted with his beloved photo camera on many occasions. Amateur/wannabe DJ, father of three and happily married keeps him busy for the remaining hours.","company":"Outerthought","talks":[{"title":"The NoSQL BOF","event":"Bof (1h)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/348"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/static/images/68/thumb.gif","firstName":"Steven"}
