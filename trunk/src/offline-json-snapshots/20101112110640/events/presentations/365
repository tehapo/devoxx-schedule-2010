{"tags":[{"name":"javaee"}],"summary":"From a technology perspective it seems dust has settled down in the JAVA/JEE world. The JEE specification has reached a mature status and a few frameworks dominate the development landscape. This is all good news since the Cloud 2 era requires even more versatile and more scalable back-end technologies.\r\n\r\nA few challenges remain. One of the more pressing challenges is productivity. The development of professional, well documented and tested JEE solutions is done at best at 11 hours per function point (according to International Software Benchmarking Standards Group - www.isbsg.org). This is not a very compelling figure making the development of JEE applications expensive.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary Festa Factory platform stands for the development of JEE applications at the rate of 3 hours per function point, which makes it unmatched in the industry. This talk will be an introduction to the Festa Factory platform. Here some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Better integration of the work of the information analyst and the programmer by using a shared graphical DSL.\r\n* Higher productivity through code generation: no more plumbing and scaffolding code! The Festa Engine currently generates 64 different types of artifacts (classes and configuration files)\r\n* Transparent linear use case based project planning and tracking\r\n\r\nWe are currently in the process of redeveloping the Festa Factory platform and have chosen the Devoxx conference as the launch moment. This talk will actually mark the birth of the Festa Factory platform. So, make sure you don't miss out the opportunity to witness this once-in-a-lifetime event!","id":365,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/309","title":"Festa Factory: Unmatched Productivity","speaker":"Franck De Bruijn","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/309","speaker":"Franck De Bruijn"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
