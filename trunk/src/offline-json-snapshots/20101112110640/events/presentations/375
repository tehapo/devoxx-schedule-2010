{"tags":[{"name":"Testing"},{"name":"loadUI"},{"name":"TDD"}],"summary":"This Quickie will be a hands-on demo of loadUI, a novel and free Open Source Load Testing tool that supports distributed load testing via an innovative JavaFX-based user interface. With loadUI you create, configure and redistribute your load tests in real time (while your tests are actually running!), giving you the unique possibility to understand how your services behave under load and when load changes. loadUI supports testing of SOAP, REST, Web, AMF, JDBC and JMS interfaces and thanks to its OSGi and Groovy based infrastructure it can easily be expanded to accommodate for any other protocol or testing requirements you might have.","id":375,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/329","title":"loadUI : A uniquely cool approach to Interactive Distributed Load Testing","speaker":"Ole Lensmar","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/329","speaker":"Ole Lensmar"}],"type":"Quickie (15m)"}
