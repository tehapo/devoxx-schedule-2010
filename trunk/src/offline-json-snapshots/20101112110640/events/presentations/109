{"tags":[{"name":"Methodology"}],"summary":"If you talk to the most well-known developers, whether they\u2019re people within your organization or internationally recognized experts, you\u2019ll find something in common: they\u2019re productive. Usually, it isn\u2019t just dumb luck. More often than not, they\u2019ve focused on becoming more productive.  \r\n\r\nThere are dozens of methodologies that claim to increase productivity, but there\u2019s a clear winner amongst highly productive software developers: Getting Things Done (GTD). GTD, originally described in productivity guru David Allen\u2019s best seller of the same title, describes a set of behaviors which, when followed regularly, reduce stress and help you become more productive at the same time. \r\n\r\nWhile GTD works for anyone who qualifies as an \u201cinformation worker\u201d, this session looks at how programmers, architects, and technical managers can apply GTD principles to improve the productivity of individuals and the group as a whole. In addition to discussing the core principles of GTD, this session also examines tools which can be used to implement the methodology. \r\n\r\n      Outline \r\n      * The Problem: too much stuff\r\n      * GTD Overview\r\n      * Applying what works\r\n      * GTD in teams\r\n      * Tools\r\n      ** Demo\r\n      * Summary","id":109,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/103","title":"Getting Things Done for Programmers","speaker":"Kito Mann","track":"Methodology","experience":"EXPERT","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/103","speaker":"Kito Mann"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
