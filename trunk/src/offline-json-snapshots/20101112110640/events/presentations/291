{"tags":[{"name":"Wicket"}],"summary":"Learn how to use Apache Wicket to create web applications on your own from the masters. This hands-on lab will provide a quick introduction to the Wicket framework and we'll start with coding right away. At the basis for this course lies the Wicket in Action book, written by the course leader. We'll start with setting up our project, move on from a simple hello world application to implementing an online cheese store. We'll learn to connect it to services delivered by Spring and a back end served with a JPA provider (Hibernate or OpenJPA). During this course we'll cover the end-to-end basics of web application development: unit testing, writing maintainable code, internationalization, security and deployment.","id":291,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/56","title":"Introducing Wicket","speaker":"Martijn Dashorst","track":"Web Frameworks","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/56","speaker":"Martijn Dashorst"}],"type":"University (3h)"}
