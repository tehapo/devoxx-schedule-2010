While Comet allows to stream data to the client there are still limitations since you need a second request to talk to the server. The WebSocket spec fixes that by introducing a bi-directional and full duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection. Coupling this with JSF, the standard way to create Java EE based web applications, creates some interesting new options in building web applications. This session gives an overview of the WebSocket API and shows you how to get started with the Glassfish and Atomsphere implementations. The session shows patterns on how to create powerful and future-proof Applications with WebSockets and JSF.","id":32,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/46","title":"WebSockets meet JavaServer Faces","speaker":"Matthias Wessendorf","track":"Web Frameworks","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/46","speaker":"Matthias Wessendorf"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
