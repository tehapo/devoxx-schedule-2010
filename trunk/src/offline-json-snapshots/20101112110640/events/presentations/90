{"tags":[{"name":"HTML5"},{"name":"jQuery"},{"name":"Prototype"}],"summary":"For the last few years, the web has been all a-twitter about web 2.0 (and even the occasional reference to web 3.0.) Yes, the days of static web applications are officially over and while libraries like jQuery and Prototype make it easier to build modern applications, ultimately they are papering over issues in the web standards (and the browsers that implement them.) Today we're building to standards that are from the paleolithic era of web design but that's changing - and HTML 5 is a large part of that. In this talk, we'll discus just what HTML 5 is and why it matters. We'll show how you can build to HTML 5 today and which browsers support what. Thankfully, after many years of stagnation, the future of web applications looks bright!","id":90,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/112","title":"HTML 5 Fact and Fiction","speaker":"Nathaniel Schutta","track":"Web Frameworks","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/112","speaker":"Nathaniel Schutta"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
