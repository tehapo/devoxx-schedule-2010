{"tags":[{"name":"EJB31"},{"name":"JSR299"},{"name":"CDI"},{"name":"BPM"},{"name":"seam"},{"name":"JSF"}],"summary":"Seam is a powerful open source development platform for building rich Internet applications in Java EE, now rebuilt on JSR-299: Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE. JSR-299 is an elegant set of new services that include dependency injection, contextual lifecycle management, configuration, interceptors and event notification. While these services are familiar, the innovative use of meta-annotations is uniquely expressive and typesafe, and a significant step forward from Seam 2. The implementation of this new programming model is provided by Weld. Seam extends the CDI programming model by providing portable enhancements, extensions and integrations that tie technologies such as Java Persistence 2 (JPA), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB 3.1), JavaServer Faces 2 (JSF), Business Process Management (BPM), business rules (Drools), reporting (PDF and Excel), security and e-mail templates into a unified full-stack solution, supported by sophisticated tooling.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Pete Muir and Dan Allen, two of the lead Seam developers, detail the state of the union for Seam 3. We'll cover how it's being reachitected on JSR-299, cover its new modularized and autonomous infrastructure and provide an overview of features, both migrated and new. This talk has a nice blend of theory and application. Audience members will take away from this talk and understanding of CDI and Seam 3 and knowledge to get their hands dirty and started developing with this platform.","id":278,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/244","title":"Seam 3: State of the Union","speaker":"Dan Allen","track":"Web Frameworks","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/244","speaker":"Dan Allen"},{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/295","speaker":"Pete Muir"}],"type":"University (3h)"}
