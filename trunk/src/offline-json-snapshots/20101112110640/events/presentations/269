{"tags":[{"name":"OAuth"},{"name":"authentication"}],"summary":"Web 2.0 technologies have made it possible to migrate traditional desktop applications to the Web, resulting in a rich and dynamic user experience and in expanded functionality. Similarly, RESTful Web services have become a commonly used model for exposing services and their APIs on the Web. As a result, a potentially large amount of personal, sensitive, and valuable data is put online, spread across various Web services. \r\n\r\nWith the increasing number of resources and services accessible over the Web, software developers are forced to provide more sophisticated and more user-friendly authentication and authorization mechanisms. Support for delegated authentication, such as OpenID, is well-supported by existing frameworks and libraries. Authorization, on the other hand, lacks a comparable support and is commonly built into existing applications or delegated using protocols that are not suitable for the open Web environment.\r\n\r\nUser Managed Access (UMA), a standardisation effort from the Kantara Initiative that is closely related to the recently emerging OAuth V2.0 protocol from IETF, proposes a new approach to access management for Web resources that includes a user as a core part of its model. UMA lets an individual control the authorization of data sharing and service access made between online services on the individual's behalf. It provides benefits for both users and application developers. The latter ones, in particular, can benefit from providing authorization mechanisms and sharing capabilities to their new or existing applications without the need of building these mechanisms by themselves.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we aim to review existing solutions to authorization for Web applications and Web services. We will introduce UMA and explain how it builds on such protocols as OAuth V2.0 and OAuth WRAP. We will then present UMA/j \u2013 a purely Java-based open-source framework that helps developers to delegate authorization from their Web applications and Web services to specialized software components. We will also demo an exemplar UMA system built with the UMA/j library that is planned to be deployed within Newcastle University to provide access control mechanisms for over 19,000 students and 4,500 staff members.","id":269,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/207","title":"Introduction to UMA/j \u2013 User Managed Access framework","speaker":"Maciej Machulak","track":"Architecture/Security","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/207","speaker":"Maciej Machulak"},{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/212","speaker":"Lukasz Moren"}],"type":"Bof (1h)"}
