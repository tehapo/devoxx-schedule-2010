If you wish to develop Desktop applications, then you\u2019ll be interested by the new features of the Adobe AIR 2 runtime. We\u2019ll see how to run offline applications, invoke a Java native process on the client side, play with your webcam or your microphone... on Windows, MAC and Linux. The last part of this session will cover Mobile and Tablet applications. Thanks to the future releases of the Flash platform, JAVA developers can rapidly develop applications for Android (and soon Blackberries, WebOS and  iOS), leveraging specific mobile APIs such as multitouch, the accelerometer, access to the camera or the microphone, etc... These three hours will give you a 360 panorama of the Adobe RIA technologies.","id":368,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/331","title":"The latest innovations of the Adobe Flash Platform for Java developers","speaker":"Michael Chaize","track":"Desktop/RIA/Mobile","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/331","speaker":"Michael Chaize"}],"type":"University (3h)"}
