{"tags":[{"name":"scalable"},{"name":"cloud"}],"summary":"Cloud computing is uncovering the weaknesses in the old three-tier web application model. Though server-side Java was built around this model, features of the Java programming language can help you build next-generation web systems that leverage different storage types and operate in a rapidly changing environment.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will cover some real world, highly scalable Java applications that leverage key characteristics of cloud-scale programming:\r\n\r\n* Using the best storage engine for the task at hand\r\n* Distributed application components running in VM isolation\r\n* When to use message queues for distributed communication\r\n* Addressing weaknesses in Java for cloud-scale systems","id":155,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/153","title":"Designing Java Systems to Operate at a Cloud Scale","speaker":"George Reese","track":"Cloud/NoSQL","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/153","speaker":"George Reese"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
