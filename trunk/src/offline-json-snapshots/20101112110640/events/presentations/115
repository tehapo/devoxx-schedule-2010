{"tags":[{"name":"VisualVM"},{"name":"JDK"},{"name":"performance"}],"summary":"VisualVM is a visual tool integrating several commandline JDK tools and lightweight profiling capabilities. Designed for both production and development time use, it further enhances the capability of monitoring and performance analysis for the Java SE platform.\r\n\r\nBut its capabilities don't stop there. VisualVM provides a rich set of APIs to quickly set up a custom monitoring and visualization solution. You can use either one of the pre-packaged data acquisition APIs (jmx, jvmstat ...) or roll-out your own and make it available for others to use (eg. a one using linux \"/proc\" as the data source).\r\n\r\nThis session will focus on explaining the APIs in terms of architecture and their usage. To help in understanding the concepts a sample VisualVM module reading and visualizing CPU information on a Linux box.","id":115,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/27","title":"VisualVM - multiplatform versatile monitoring solution","speaker":"Jaroslav Bachorik","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/27","speaker":"Jaroslav Bachorik"}],"type":"Tools in Action (30m)"}
