{"tags":[{"name":"scala"},{"name":"REPL"}],"summary":"Scala fuses object-oriented and functional programming concepts into an elegant, statically typed programming language for the Java Platform. In 2010, Scala received a major upgrade in the Scala 2.8 release. This talk will give an overview of what's new in Scala 2.8, covering topics such as the redesigned collections library, new array implementation, type specialization, named and default arguments, package objects, the revamped REPL (Scala interpreter), a new implicit resolution process, improved equality, improved annotations, enhanced actors, and support for continuations. The talk will be designed for Java programmers, so you need not already know Scala to benefit from this talk.","id":318,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/273","title":"What's New in Scala 2.8?","speaker":"Bill Venners","track":"New Languages on the JVM","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/273","speaker":"Bill Venners"},{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/272","speaker":"Dick Wall"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
