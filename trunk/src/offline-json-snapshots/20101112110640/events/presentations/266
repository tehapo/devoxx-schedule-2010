{"tags":[{"name":"scala"}],"summary":"Once you get used to use Scala's bigger toolbox it will strike you how much a Java programmer has to please the language instead of solving the problems at hand. But even if your organisation forces you to use Java, learning Scala will change the way you swing your Golden Java Hammer. You'll start to mimic programming concepts that Scala smoothly introduces in your Java code and have pain that some can't be achieved easily. Immutable instances, small methods without side-effects and small classes are signs of a programmer thinking in Scala, even though Java makes it slightly harder to program that way. \r\nThe pain comes when you got used to Scala's ways of object composition and the often cited closures. \r\nJava let's you do the same things - if you really want to. Java's boilerplate code will hide what you try to achieve. Achieving programming concepts you have at hand with Scala in pure Java does rarely bear its weight.\r\nIn this talk we'll go through some of the things a Scala-trained programmer will start to use in Java. We'll look at the things you can achieve easily and show examples for when you'll miss Scala.
