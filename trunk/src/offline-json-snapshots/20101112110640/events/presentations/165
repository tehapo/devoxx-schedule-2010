{"tags":[{"name":"grails"},{"name":"Eclipse"},{"name":"groovy"}],"summary":"Come and see the latest developments in Groovy and Grails tooling for Eclipse.  We'll look at the great Groovy editing experience based around a sophisticated inferencing engine, and also how support is now in place for many of the standard Eclipse features that developers are so used to when working with their Java code: formatting, refactoring, javadoc, task tags, debugging (incl. hotswap).  Building on Groovy we'll then look at the latest Grails development features (including plugin management, navigation, gsp editing, local plugin support).","id":165,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/159","title":"Groovy/Grails Development in Eclipse","speaker":"Christian Dupuis","track":"New Languages on the JVM","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/159","speaker":"Christian Dupuis"}],"type":"Tools in Action (30m)"}
