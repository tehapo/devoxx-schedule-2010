{"tags":[{"name":"adobe"},{"name":"XML"},{"name":"PDF"}],"summary":"This year's Conference Guide is created using iText, a Java-PDF library.\n\nIn the first part of the session, we'll examine the guide, and we'll make an inventory of all the possible technical problems that have to be countered if you want to create the guide in an automated way.  We'll have a brief look at the iText mechanisms that allow us to take these hurdles, after which we'll dive into the source code that did the job. This way, you'll learn how to create a PDF that is ready for publication.\n\nIn the second part, we'll discuss some more interactive features of PDF.\nYou'll learn about the difference between the old AcroForm technology and the newer XML Forms Architecture (XFA). We'll create different PDF forms using either Open Office (AcroForm) or Adobe Designer (XFA), and we'll fill out these forms using iText.\nFinally, we'll write a small Flash application in Flex that will be integrated into a PDF, taking a glimpse at the way the ActionScript in the Flash app communicates with the JavaScript in the PDF document.\n\nThese examples are taken from the second edition of \"iText in Action,\" published by Manning Publications Co.","id":60,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/83","title":"iText in Action, release of the second edition","speaker":"Bruno Lowagie","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/83","speaker":"Bruno Lowagie"}],"type":"University (3h)"}
