{"tags":[{"name":"javase"},{"name":"closures"},{"name":"Lambda"}],"summary":"OpenJDK's Project Lambda is exploring Java language features designed to increase the productivity of developers working with novel parallel APIs such as the Fork/Join Framework. But in fact, the features being explored will work in conjunction with any API, and strong idioms will be needed to get both performance and correctness in the face of these features. This session will cover the primary features of Project Lambda, such as lambda expressions and function types, and discuss best practices for API designers and consumers looking to use them.","id":345,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/283","title":"Project Lambda: To Multicore and Beyond","speaker":"Brian Goetz","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"EXPERT","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/283","speaker":"Brian Goetz"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
