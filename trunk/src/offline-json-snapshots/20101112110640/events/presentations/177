{"tags":[{"name":"Glassfish"},{"name":"javaee6"}],"summary":"With the completed acquisition of Sun Microsystems by Oracle in January 2010, several people were left wondering what would happen to the GlassFish open source application server. Conscious that the community was worried about what new employer of the majority of GlassFish contributors would do with the project, Oracle communicated a roadmap two months after the acquisition to reaffirm its investment and commitment.\r\n\r\nThis BOF will cover where GlassFish stands today with full support of the new Java EE 6 specification, OSGi modularity but will also take the audience through what is in store for the future of the community of open source product such as clustering in the 3.1 release.\r\n\r\nWe will also present how recent external contributions helped shape GlassFish features (SERLI's application versioning feature is a very likely candidate for this) and discuss how the community could encourage even more participation.","id":177,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/182","title":"The future of the GlassFish community","speaker":"Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine","track":"Java Core (SE/EE)","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/182","speaker":"Alexis Moussine-Pouchkine"}],"type":"Bof (1h)"}
