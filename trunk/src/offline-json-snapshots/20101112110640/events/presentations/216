{"tags":[{"name":"MongoDB"},{"name":"NoSQL"}],"summary":"MongoDB (from \"humongous\") is a high-performance, open source, schema-free, non-relational, document-oriented database. We'll present the fundamental principles of MongoDB, how to set up and interact with the database, and what to consider when building applications using a document-based data model. We'll contrast MongoDB with relational databases and with some NoSQL counterparts. This workshop will cover:\r\n \r\n    * How to install and configure MongoDB\r\n    * Basic administration via MongoDB's JavaScript console\r\n    * How the MongoDB drivers work, and how to use them to build applications\r\n    * Data modeling with MongoDB documents\r\n    * When to use MongoDB, when another database type might be a better choice\r\n    * Scaling with MongoDB (master/slave configurations and auto-sharding)\r\n    * Unique database features, including capped collections, large file storage, and atomic updates","id":216,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/296","title":"Building Web Applications with MongoDB","speaker":"Roger Bodamer","track":"Cloud/NoSQL","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/296","speaker":"Roger Bodamer"}],"type":"University (3h)"}
