{"tags":[{"name":"AuthZ"},{"name":"authentication"},{"name":"OpenAM"},{"name":"authorization"}],"summary":"As web applications become the norm for application delivery mechanisms, there is more and more demand for managing access control at the application framework level.  As is immediately obvious, managing this access control becomes an overwhelming  overhead for the actual application,  and should be handled by the underlying framework used for application delivery.\r\n\r\nOpensource projects such as ForgeRock OpenAM,  (Formerly OpenSSO) can provide both Authentication services, as well as Authorization services to applications, utilising a simple REST or SOAP based web service interface.  All the management of users, groups and other authentication attributes can be handled by the AuthN/AuthZ application, and delivered to the web application as a service.  We can already see this behavior in use,  in PAM, or pluggable authentication modules used in many linux environments in use today.  However mere authentication is not sufficient in an enterprise environment. Often,  group, Community and other membership, or attributes, need to be used to determine access control.\r\n\r\nUtilizing an external Access control service,  such as OpenAM, can offload much of this access control from the application, allowing the access control layer to be provided through a simple, effective Web Service permissions layer.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will demonstrate how the OpenAM authN and AuthZ layers can be simply and easily integrated into an enterprise application, allowing fine grained access control to be enforced at the\r\napplication layer,  while allowing the administration and management of the policies to be handled by the service provider.","id":378,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/301","title":"Opensource Authentication and Authorization","speaker":"Allan Foster","track":"Architecture/Security","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/301","speaker":"Allan Foster"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
