{"tags":[{"name":"Methodology"}],"summary":"The Productive Programmer consists of two parts: mechanics & practice. In the mechanics section, I identify 4 principles of productivity: acceleration, focus, automation, and canonicality. This session defines the principles and describes their use, but the primary focus of this workshop is real-world examples of how you can use these principles to make yourself a more productive programmer. The second part of this workshop covers 10 ways to improve your code, derived from the practices section. This workshop includes tons of examples, all culled from real-world projects.","id":328,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/276","title":"Productive Programmer","speaker":"Neal Ford","track":"Methodology","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/276","speaker":"Neal Ford"}],"type":"University (3h)"}
