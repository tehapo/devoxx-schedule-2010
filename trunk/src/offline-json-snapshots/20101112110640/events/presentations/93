But by now, the really interesting systems are those built on the Web, with non-functional requirements that make even the biggest banking or insurance app pale in comparison. Integration, as practiced on the Web, is also widely different from the typical enterprise IT approach - yet it seems to yield results that outshine years of effort in most large companies.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll take a look at how the typical enterprise IT landscape can benefit from the Web's architecture, what Java developers need to learn to be part of this, and why the whole idea of \"applications\" is going to disappear.","id":93,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/118","title":"Enterprise IT vs. WWW","speaker":"Stefan Tilkov","track":"Architecture/Security","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/118","speaker":"Stefan Tilkov"}],"type":"Conference (1h)"}
