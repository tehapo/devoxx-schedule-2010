Now those days are gone, and pretty soon the smartphones will outnumber the desktops, laptops and netbooks connected to the Internet.\r\n\r\nBut writing a good web application is no small feat though, as mobile devices are bandwidth-constrained and are not guaranteed to be permanently online, so a good mobile web applications should take care of these constraints by both being capable of working offline and reducing bandwidth usage and server round-trips.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show you why the Google Web Toolkit and App Engine are the ideal Java frameworks to deliver a first-class mobile web application: optimized, ready to scale and offline-enabled.
