This session will explore the features offered by JavaConfig, what makes it stand out from other annotation-based configurations and what it takes to integrate it _immediately_ into an existing application whether for wiring up one's own components, custom APIs or third-party libraries.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to the DI flavours talk, which gives an overview of all configuration features and how they relate to each other, this presentation focuses only on JavaConfig and the opportunities it offers.","id":28,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/37","title":"Spring 3 Java Config","speaker":"Costin Leau","track":"Architecture/Security","experience":"NOVICE","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/37","speaker":"Costin Leau"}],"type":"Quickie (15m)"}
