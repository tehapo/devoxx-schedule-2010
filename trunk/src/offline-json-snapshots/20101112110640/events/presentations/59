{"tags":[{"name":"URL"},{"name":"Faces"},{"name":"JSF"}],"summary":"Java EE is already the perfect solution for complex business/enterprise systems, and the improvements in JavaServer Faces 2.x provide the perfect chance to reach out to the consumer and small business market; JSF is easier to use than it's ever been before, now making it accessible to businesses of all sizes. In order to complete the user-experience, however, one must take extra steps to ensure that users see exactly the right information at the right time, and in a form that is welcoming. URL-rewriting is beneficial in any project (small and large,) and this tools session will present why \"pretty, bookmark-able URLs\" are important for client-facing applications, building trust, creating clean, consistent, intuitive client interactions on the web.\n\nAttendees should expect an overview covering the basics of inbound/outbound URL-rewriting, parametrization, and navigation - important principles that target the highly discriminating web-users found everywhere today. They will also be presented with a case study of the Parlays.com HTML 5 application, in which an existing JSF application is transformed from using standard URLs with query parameters, to using logical, well-structured, human-readable URLs (with PrettyFaces path-parametrization).","id":59,"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/71","title":"Beautiful Java EE: URL-rewriting for the next generation web-user","speaker":"Lincoln Baxter III","track":"Web Frameworks","experience":"SENIOR","speakers":[{"speakerUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/speakers/71","speaker":"Lincoln Baxter III"}],"type":"Tools in Action (30m)"}
