{"id":6,"lastName":"Laforge","bio":"Guillaume Laforge is the project lead of Groovy, the highly popular and successful dynamic language for the JVM. He co-authored Manning's best seller \"Groovy in Action\" with Dierk KÃ¶nig, and is working for SpringSource (a division of VMWare) where he's working full time on cool and Groovy stuff. Guillaume worked hand in hand with the Google App Engine Java team before the official launch of the new platform to ensure that Groovy would run well on this new cloud. With this background in mind, he created Gaelyk, a lightweight toolkit for developing applications written in Groovy on Google App Engine, that he demonstrated at the Google I/O 2009 Conference. ou can meet Guillaume at conferences around the world where he evangelizes the Groovy dynamic language, Domain-Specific Languages in Groovy, and the agile Grails web framework.","company":"SpringSource","talks":[{"title":"Groovy update, ecosystem, and skyrocketing to the cloud with App Engine and Gaelyk!","event":"University (3h)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/284"},{"title":"Groovy/Grails Get Together","event":"Bof (1h)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/350"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/static/images/6/thumbnail.gif","firstName":"Guillaume"}
