{"id":110,"lastName":"Vos","bio":"Johan Vos started to work with Java in 1995. He worked on the Java Linux port with the Blackdown team. He has been doing Java consulting and development for a number of customers in completely different areas. Over the years, he has been active in a number of Java-based community projects, e.g. OSGi, the Glassfish project and JFXtras.org.\r\nWith LodgON, the company he co-founded, he is mainly working on Java solutions for social networking software. \r\nSince he can't make a choice between embedded development and enterprise development, his main focus is on end-to-end Java, combining the strengths of back-end systems and embedded devices. His favourite technologies are currently Java EE / Glassfish at the backend and JavaFX at the frond-end.","company":"LodgON","talks":[{"title":"Using RedFX to connect JavaFX clients and Java Enterprise systems","event":"Tools in Action (30m)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/317"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/static/images/110/thumbnail.gif","firstName":"Johan"}
