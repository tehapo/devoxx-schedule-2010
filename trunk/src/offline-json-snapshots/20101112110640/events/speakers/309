He worked for companies like Ericsson, UPS Logistics and Logica learning the ropes by passing through a variety of roles: developer, software architect, information analyst and IT manager (see also http://nl.linkedin.com/in/franckdebruijn).\r\n\r\nFor many years, Franck has studied all aspects of the development of multi-channel purpose-built enterprise administration systems. This resulted in the creation of the Festa Factory platform, which has been put into practice successfully since 2008 for 2 customers. Excited by these results, Franck now aims to bring the Festa Factory as open source product to the JAVA/JEE community.","company":"Festa Factory BV","talks":[{"title":"Festa Factory: Unmatched Productivity","event":"Conference (1h)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/365"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/img/thumbnail.gif","firstName":"Franck"}
