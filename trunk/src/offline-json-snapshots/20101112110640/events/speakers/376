{"id":376,"lastName":"RÃ¶mer","bio":"Toomas was a R&D specialist in Webmedia and has been the core developer for ZeroTurnaround\u2019s products since 2007. Once a Linux junkie, he was fooled by Apple into proprietory OS and devices.\r\n\r\nHe is a big fan of JUGs, OSS communities and beer. He blogs at dow.ngra.de, tweets from @toomasr and also runs the chesspastebin.com website.\r\n\r\nIn his spare time he crashes Lexus\u2019 while test driving them, plays chess, Go and Starcraft. Looks can fool you; he will probably beat you in Squash.","company":"ZeroTurnaround","talks":[{"title":"Instant Updates and Rollbacks in Production Applications","event":"Quickie (15m)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/385"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/img/thumbnail.gif","firstName":"Toomas"}
