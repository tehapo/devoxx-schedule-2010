During his studies he was an Erasmus Exchange Student at Newcastle University. Maciej Machulak additionally completed the Advanced MSc degree in \"System Design for Internet Applications\" (SDIA) in 2007 at Newcastle University and his thesis was awarded Best 2007 SDIA Thesis. This degree included an industrial placement at Red Hat UK Ltd. Maciej's main task was to develop a framework for transactional Web Services. Before commencing his PhD studies Maciej was also employed as an intern at Red Hat and worked on embedded tools for transaction monitoring inside JBoss Application Server.\r\n\r\nMaciej Machulak is currently a PhD student working with Prof. Aad van Moorsel on the Trust Economics project, funded by the UK Technology Strategy Board (TSB). Maciej's project is concerned with building a novel authorization system for Web environment which allows users to flexibly adapt access control for their Web resources to their particular security requirements.\r\n\r\nMaciej's work is currently closely related to research done by the User-Managed Access Work Group (UMA WG - charter of the Kantara Initiative). The aim of the UMA WG is to develop specifications that let an individual control the authorization of data sharing and service access made between online services on the individual's behalf, and to facilitate interoperable implementations of these specifications. Maciej is a vice-chair, specification editor, implementation coordinator and use cases editor of this WG. He has recently won funding from JISC/HEFCE for the SMART (Student-Managed Access to Online Resources) project that aims to build an UMA-based authorisation solution purely in Java and to deploy this system within Newcastle University. Maciej has been employed by Newcastle University as a Research Associate to become the Project Manager for SMART.","company":"Newcastle University","talks":[{"title":"Introduction to UMA/j \u2013 User Managed Access framework","event":"Bof (1h)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/269"},{"title":"Introduction to UMA/j \u2013 User Managed Access framework","event":"Tools in Action (30m)","presentationUri":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/rest/v1/events/presentations/270"}],"imageURI":"http://cfp.devoxx.com/static/images/207/thumbnail.gif","firstName":"Maciej"}
